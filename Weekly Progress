## ðŸ“… Week 03

### ðŸ—“ Day 01 (2025-10-20)
#### Key Accomplishments:
```
- Completed major upload and integration of the backend codebase for **Kisan+ - Your Farming Assistant**.
- Merged all backend modulesâ€”user authentication, crop diagnosis API, and database modelsâ€”into the main branch.
- Added `.gitignore` for improved repository hygiene (excluded `.env`, `venv`, logs, and cache).
- Finished backend restructuring: optimized import patterns and reorganized project folders for clarity and scalability.
```
#### Goals for Next Day:
```
- Review and test all backend routes after major merge.
- Update API documentation to reflect latest endpoints and integrations.
- Collaborate with frontend and ML teams to finalize model deployment strategy.
```
#### ðŸ‘¥ Team Contributions
```
* **[Ramitha Chowdhary]:** Led complete backend upload, merge to main, and restructuring effort; added `.gitignore` for repo hygiene.
* **[A. Nabithra]:** Provided feedback on backend structure, verified ML/DB integration points.
```
