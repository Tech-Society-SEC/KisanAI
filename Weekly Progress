## ðŸ“… Week 01
### ðŸ—“ Day 01 (2025-10-14)
## Key Accomplishments:
```
- Defined the main problem statement and core objectives for **Kisan+ - Your Farming Assistant**.
- Designed initial **user-friendly interface** (voice-first).
- Gathered and reviewed relevant datasets for **crop diagnosis ML model**.
- Defined Backened Structure,UI flow,core MVP features.
```
## Goals for Next Day:
```
- Preprocess and analyze the crop image dataset for ML training.
- Start implementing the basic **crop disease diagnosis ML model** (image classification).
- Collaborate with backend team on data formats for model integration.
- Prepare documentation for frontend-backend-ML interaction.
```
#### ðŸ‘¥ **Team Contributions**
```
* **[A.Nabithra]:** ML dataset research and design plan for crop diagnosis model
* **[Ramitha Chowdhary]:** Set up FastAPI backend structure and PostgreSQL database.
```
### ðŸ—“ Day 02 (2025-10-15)
## Key Accomplishments:
```
- Began initial setup for the **Kisan+** project implementation phase.  
- Installed and configured essential **libraries and dependencies** for backend and ML modules.  
- Organized the project structure with proper **directory setup** for scalability and maintenance.  
- Downloaded and prepared **sample datasets** from Kaggle for preliminary ML testing.  
- Established foundation for model integration and API structure in upcoming sessions.
```
## Goals for Next Day:
```
- Create proper **API endpoints** for user operations and database handling.  
- Start building and testing the **crop disease prediction ML model** using the prepared datasets.
```
#### ðŸ‘¥ **Team Contributions**
```
* **[Ramitha Chowdhary]:** Installed all required libraries through VS Code, finalized tech stack (FastAPI, PostgreSQL, TensorFlow), and organized project structure.  
* **[A. Nabithra]:** Collected relevant sample datasets from Kaggle and prepared data directories for ML model input.
